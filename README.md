## Conclusion
- Between Dense Network, LSTM Model, and Bi-Directional LSTM, Dense Network has the highest accuracy.  
- Data overfitting would reduce accuracy of the model  
- With close to 80% accuracy, our model did well on the classification most of the time.  
- Using real life example tweets, our model successfully classified tweets, with 1 false positive out of 14 tweets
